/*
 * Programming Quiz: Semicolons! (2-8)
 */

var thingOne = "red";
var thingTwo = " blue";
console.log(thingOne + thingTwo);

/* 
What Went Well
- Your code should have a variable thingOne
- Your code should have a variable thingTwo
- Your code should only have one console.log statement
- Your code should print out the values of thingOne and thingTwo using concatenation
- Your code should contain semicolons at the end of each line
